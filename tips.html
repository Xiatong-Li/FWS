        <h2> Tips for Future </h2>
        <p> Question the Source of Information </p>
        <p> Not all health advice on social media comes from qualified professionals. Before adopting a new diet or food trend, check if the creator has credible qualifications or references. Look for information backed by registered dietitians, nutritionists, or trusted health organizations.</p>
        <p> Focus on Your Unique Needs </p>
        <p> Social media often promotes universal solutions for healthy eating, but everyone has different health needs. Instead of following generic trends, consult a healthcare professional or conduct research to determine what works best for your body and lifestyle. </p>
        <p> Diversify Your Food Inspiration </p>
        <p> Avoid getting stuck in a cycle of consuming repetitive, trending content. Actively seek out diverse recipes, cultural cuisines, and balanced meal ideas to broaden your perspective on healthy eating. Don’t let social media guilt you into restrictive eating patterns. Enjoy all foods in moderation while maintaining overall balance. </p>
        <p> Be Wary of "Perfect" Images </p>
        <p> Remember that food photos and videos on social media are curated for aesthetic appeal, not practicality or healthiness. A picture-perfect dish might not meet your nutritional needs or be realistic for your daily life. </p>
        <p> Avoid Peer Pressure in Food Choices </p>
        <p> Seeing friends or influencers repeatedly post about specific foods can create a subconscious urge to try them. Pause and ask yourself if you're genuinely interested or just trying to fit in with a trend. </p>
        <p> Check for Hidden Values </p>
        <p> Social media algorithms and influencers often promote products tied to marketing campaigns. Be cautious about overly commercialized health trends that may prioritize sales over your well-being. </p>
        <p> Build Your Knowledge </p>
        <p> Use social media as a starting point, not the final word. If you see a recipe or trend that interests you, look up additional resources or studies to ensure it aligns with your goals. </p>

        <h3> Why Matters? </h3>
        <p> Food is more than sustenance, it’s a reflection of culture, identity, and social belonging. Social media taps into these elements, influencing not just what we eat but how we perceive ourselves and others. Whether through peer pressure to conform to trending diets or algorithm-driven exposure to specific food content, our choices are increasingly shaped by digital platforms. </p>
        <p> Recognizing these influences allows us to regain control over our diets. By critically assessing the content we consume and prioritizing personal health over social expectations, we can foster healthier relationships with food. </p>
