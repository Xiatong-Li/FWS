        <h2> Social Media and Food </h2>
        <p> Welcome to Social Media and Food, a platform dedicated to exploring the powerful impact of social media on the way we think about, choose, and consume food. In today’s digital age, every scroll through Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube presents us with numerous aesthetically pleasing dishes, trendy recipes, and health advice. Our mission is to shed light on how social media shapes our food choices and empower you to make decisions that truly suit your health and lifestyle.</p>

        <h3> Food on Social Media </h3>
        <p> Social media platforms have become an inseparable part of many people’s lives, especially teenagers. For Gen Z, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube are some of the most popular social media platforms. “Over 75% of Gen Z follow at least one influencer on social media.” People use social media platforms to maintain relationships with others, share their daily lives, and more importantly, acquire new information on various topics. </p>
        <p> Among these, food has become a common theme of posts on social media. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok are filled with millions of posts showcasing mouth-watering dishes and recipes. “39% of Instagram users explore food content, with 27% of them sharing food-related videos and photos. The hashtag “food is used on Instagram 250 million times.” More specifically, “young people are exposed to food marketing around 30-189 times per week on social media.” These posts not only generate cravings but also subtly dictate what foods are perceived as desirable, nutritious, or socially acceptable. Whether it’s a friend sharing a trendy recipe or an influencer posting an impeccably styled smoothie bowl, social media plays a pivotal role in shaping our eating habits. </p>

        <h3> Pros </h3>
        <p> Food-related contents on social media can help raise awareness regarding healthier food choices and diets. “More than half of U.S. adults across all age and ethnic/ racial groups use the Internet to search for health.” On social media, people can adopt a healthier diet by following more nutritional and balanced recipes. Also, people can have a better understanding of the food they eat and how the food contributes to their health by reading the posts of professionals in the health industry on social media. Social media allows these seemingly academic health contents to be presented in an approachable and understandable way with the combination of texts and visual images. </p>
        <p> With the platforms created by social media, one can communicate and build connections with others across geographical boundaries. “Feeling empowered in decision making about one’s health” can significantly help one maintain those healthy behaviors. By following those health trends on social media, one may feel aligned with influential celebrities and friends which greatly empowers one’s healthy behaviors. </p>

        <h3> Cons </h3>
        <p> The accuracy and credibility of the information related to food need a second thought. When social media provides a platform for everyone to become a content producer, it also means that everyone is able to spread health campaigns without any verification. Most influencers online are not professionals in the health industry and don’t have any professional backgrounds. However, as long as one influencer has many fans and is influential, the diet he or she promotes will be considered a healthy diet. Many influencers don’t “fully understand the impact of what they are promoting to impressionable minds and the repercussions that may have over the long term.” </p>
        <p> As everyone can share their diets on social media, it seems that people can have access to more diverse diets. However, the portrayal of a healthy diet on social media is actually more fixed. When thinking of healthy food, one may think of all those delicate pictures of yogurt bowls decorated with colorful fruits, salad bowls with all kinds of green vegetables, or avocados accompanied with whole-grain open toasts. According to the study, the hashtag “healthyfood” most frequently comes together with hashtags “weightloss”, “vegan”, and “homemade.” Although everyone may have distinct health problems, social media provides a uniform answer to everyone. In this process, influencers not only spread this diet, they also form communities with their followers. Hence, adhering to this diet also means adhering to a certain set of community values and establishing belongingness. This intricate bonding between users and healthy diets on social makes the spread of a fixed standard of healthy diet easier. </p>
