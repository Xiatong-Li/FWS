        <h2> 2024 TikTok Food Trends </h2>
        <p> TikTok has become a leading destination for recipe content, and while that's not always a good thing, these viral dishes have made an impact on our culture, whether we like it or not. From the OG baked feta pasta to the butter board that took the internet by storm, TikTok is a breeding ground for culinary innovation. </p>

        <h3> Tomato Ice Toast </h3>
        <p> It garnered quite the mixed response. "Spectacular give me 14 of them right now," one user joked, while another added, "frozen tomato will be tasteless with ice crystals…actually nothing I want to try." </p>
        <p> "Was a little skeptical at first but now I don’t wanna eat it any other way," a third person wrote. </p>

        <h3> Chamoy Pickle </h3>
        <p> This one is controversial for a reason. The trend, which has appeared in thousands of TikTok videos, includes a dill pickle soaked in a combo of chamoy, sweet and sour candy powders, and tajin. It's then wrapped in a fruit roll up and stuffed with Takis. It's a sweet and spicy combo that's terrifying by appearance alone. </p>
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@claudiaeatsgood/video/7367491222862122286?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121489688%3Bnull%3Bembed_card_play&refer=embed&referer_url=www.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa61827448%2Fbiggest-tiktok-food-trends-2024%2F&referer_video_id=7320302201207819562">

        <h3> Sleepy Girl Mocktail </h3>
        <p> In early 2024, the Sleepy Girl Mocktail exploded on TikTok as a miracle beverage of sorts. The concoction—of tart cherry juice, seltzer, and a scoop of magnesium—can reportedly lull you to sleep and keep you in a blissful REM all night long. </p>
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kaylagresh/video/7293972130968964395?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121489688%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&refer=embed&referer_url=www.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa61827448%2Fbiggest-tiktok-food-trends-2024%2F&referer_video_id=7293972130968964395">

        <h3> Chickle </h3>
        <p> So you're not a Chamoy Pickle Kit girlie. The chickle might be the alternative you've been waiting for. There's nothing to not like about the creation. It's just a fried cheese-wrapped pickle, and it also takes just a quick minute to make. </p>
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shewillevolve/video/7313635432112114974?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121489688%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&refer=embed&referer_url=www.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa61827448%2Fbiggest-tiktok-food-trends-2024%2F&referer_video_id=7313635432112114974">

        <h3> Tanghulu </h3>
        <p> Tanghulu is the ultimate ASMR food trend. The viral dessert is actually a traditional Chinese street food that's captured the hearts of social media users thanks to its sweet, juicy fruit interior and candied shell, which can be accomplished by boiling water and sugar on the stove to create a sugary exterior. </p>
        <p> TikTokers have gotten creative with it too and tried all sorts of fruit: pineapple, grapes, strawberries, kiwi, you name it.</p>
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@abigailfmarquez/video/7326892850531028230?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121489688%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&refer=embed&referer_url=www.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa61827448%2Fbiggest-tiktok-food-trends-2024%2F&referer_video_id=7326892850531028230">

        <h3> Scrambled Pancakes </h3>
        <p> Scrambled pancakes became a trend earlier this summer. The polarizing recipe (classic pancakes scrambled like eggs with a spatula) sent TikTok into a tailspin. Even though the original creator admitted it was just a bit and actually hated this new take on a classic breakfast, some fans...didn't. They called it "genius" and "so appealing." To each's own, I suppose. </p>
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katclark/video/7383804138267757840?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121489688%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&refer=embed&referer_url=www.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa61827448%2Fbiggest-tiktok-food-trends-2024%2F&referer_video_id=7383804138267757840">

        <h3> Ramen Carbonara </h3>
        <p> You can't tell me the Buldak ramen carbonara doesn't look so amazing. The cult-fave boxed noodle brand got a serious upgrade when TikTokers decided, 'Hey, why not toss it on the stove with heavy cream and egg?' </p>
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dear.haeun/video/7361948056369138990?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121489688%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&refer=embed&referer_url=www.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa61827448%2Fbiggest-tiktok-food-trends-2024%2F&referer_video_id=7361948056369138990">

        <h3> Cereal Milk Latte </h3>
        <p> Wanna play barista? The cereal milk latte is one recipe to add to your roster (if you haven't already). The process is pretty easy too and customizable based on your fave cereal. Simply, toss your go-to brand in a bowl of milk and let it soak, before straining out the cereal and using the milk for your late. It's sugary but not overpowering, with a dash of childhood breakfast nostalgia. </p>
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@morgandrinkscoffee/video/7381880879724907819?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121489688%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&refer=embed&referer_url=www.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa61827448%2Fbiggest-tiktok-food-trends-2024%2F&referer_video_id=7381880879724907819">

        <h3> Cucumber Jars </h3>
        <p> You've probably heard of the cucumber guy (aka @logagm) or seen him splashed across your For You page by now, but food creator's viral cucumber jars are a thing you might want to recreate.</p>
        <p> While shakeable salads are sorta his thing, he's also whipped up cucumber kimchi, a cucumber flight, and the iconic cucumber appetizer from Din Tai Fung, among other recipes.</p>
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@logagm/video/7396063954482547973?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121489688%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&refer=embed&referer_url=www.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa61827448%2Fbiggest-tiktok-food-trends-2024%2F&referer_video_id=7396063954482547973">

        <h3> Making EVERYTHING from Scratch </h3>
        <p> While TikTok's Nara smith certainly didn't invent from-scratch cooking, her videos—which feature her ambitious cooking endeavors—have certainly catapulted her into trending status. She's whipped up cereal, potato chips, and so much more, all from scratch.</p>
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@naraazizasmith/video/7328514190765804843?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121489688%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&refer=embed&referer_url=www.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa61827448%2Fbiggest-tiktok-food-trends-2024%2F&referer_video_id=7328514190765804843">
